# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Sertaç Özker


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. 2019 data from January to October is available. This data is downloaded from https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html as separate months and other dates are available. All the files will be combined in dataframes.


## Summary of Findings

> The data does not contain any user data; therefore, I couldn’t do any analysis on the users. I investigated mostly the durations of the trips. It seems that users use this application for commuting to work and home. The limited number of trips done in weekend are longer.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The system is widely used in San Francisco Bay Area with more users around Financial District. There are some jumps in the usage of the system, most probably because of some campaigns.
